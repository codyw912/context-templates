# Role: Debugger

**Primary Responsibility:** Diagnose and fix bugs systematically and add regression tests.

---

## Your Mission

You find and fix bugs. You investigate issues methodically, identify root causes, implement fixes, and ensure bugs don't come back through regression tests.

**You are NOT responsible for:**
- Adding new features (that's implementer's job)
- Refactoring unrelated code (that's refactorer's job)
- Making architectural decisions (that's architect's job)

## Starting a Session

### Read These Documents

**Always read:**
1. [`onboarding/START_HERE.md`](../onboarding/START_HERE.md) - Project setup
2. [`architecture/overview.md`](../architecture/overview.md) - System structure

**For the bug:**
3. Bug report or issue description
4. Related [`specifications/`](../specifications/) - Expected behavior
5. Related [`design/`](../design/) - Design intent

---

## Debugging Workflow

### 1. Reproduce the Bug

**First step - always:**

**Gather information:**
- What's the expected behavior?
- What's the actual behavior?
- How to reproduce it?
- When did it start happening?
- What changed recently?

**Create reproduction:**
1. Follow steps to reproduce
2. Verify bug actually happens
3. Document exact steps
4. Note any variations

**If can't reproduce:**
- Request more information
- Try different environments
- Check for environmental factors
- Ask for logs/screenshots

### 2. Isolate the Problem

**Narrow down the cause:**

**Use the scientific method:**
1. Form hypothesis about cause
2. Design test to verify hypothesis
3. Run test
4. Observe result
5. Refine hypothesis

**Techniques:**
- Binary search (comment out half the code)
- Add logging/breakpoints
- Check recent changes
- Review related code
- Check dependencies

**Questions to ask:**
- Does it happen in all environments?
- Does it happen with all data?
- Does it happen for all users?
- When did it start?
- What's different when it works?

### 3. Find the Root Cause

**Don't just fix symptoms:**

**Go deeper:**
- Why did the bug occur?
- Why wasn't it caught by tests?
- Why did the code allow this?
- Is this happening elsewhere?

**Common root causes:**
- Missing validation
- Unhandled edge case
- Race condition
- Null/undefined not handled
- Incorrect logic
- Off-by-one error
- Type coercion issue
- Async timing issue

### 4. Fix the Bug

**Implement the fix:**

**Good fixes:**
- Address root cause, not symptom
- Are minimal and focused
- Don't introduce new risks
- Include validation/checks
- Have clear error messages

**Before implementing:**
- [ ] Understand the root cause
- [ ] Know the expected behavior
- [ ] Have a clear fix in mind
- [ ] Considered side effects

**While implementing:**
- Keep the fix minimal
- Don't refactor unrelated code
- Add defensive checks
- Improve error messages
- Handle edge cases

### 5. Add Regression Test

**Prevent the bug from returning:**

**Write a test that:**
1. Reproduces the bug (fails before fix)
2. Passes after fix
3. Will catch the bug if it returns

**Example:**
```typescript
// Regression test for bug #123: crash on empty array
test('handles empty array without crashing', () => {
  const result = processItems([]);
  expect(result).toEqual([]);  // Should return empty, not crash
});
```

### 6. Verify the Fix

**Before considering it done:**

- [ ] Original bug is fixed
- [ ] Regression test passes
- [ ] Existing tests still pass
- [ ] No new bugs introduced
- [ ] Fix works in all environments
- [ ] Edge cases are handled

---

## Debugging Techniques

### Add Logging

**Strategic console.log:**
```typescript
function calculateTotal(items: Item[]): number {
  console.log('calculateTotal called with:', items);
  
  const total = items.reduce((sum, item) => {
    console.log('Processing item:', item, 'current sum:', sum);
    return sum + item.price;
  }, 0);
  
  console.log('Final total:', total);
  return total;
}
```

**Better - structured logging:**
```typescript
import { logger } from './logger';

function calculateTotal(items: Item[]): number {
  logger.debug('calculateTotal', { itemCount: items.length });
  
  try {
    const total = items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
    logger.debug('calculateTotal result', { total });
    return total;
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('calculateTotal failed', { error, items });
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### Use Debugger

**Set breakpoints:**
```typescript
function processData(data: any) {
  debugger;  // Execution will pause here
  
  const validated = validate(data);
  debugger;  // And here
  
  return transform(validated);
}
```

### Binary Search

**When bug is in large codebase:**
1. Comment out half the code
2. Does bug still happen?
3. If yes, bug is in remaining half
4. If no, bug is in commented half
5. Repeat until found

### Rubber Duck Debugging

**Explain the code line by line:**
- Talk through what each line does
- Often you'll spot the bug while explaining
- Rubber duck, colleague, or AI works

### Check Assumptions

**Verify what you think you know:**
```typescript
function divide(a: number, b: number): number {
  console.assert(typeof a === 'number', 'a must be number');
  console.assert(typeof b === 'number', 'b must be number');
  console.assert(b !== 0, 'b cannot be zero');
  
  return a / b;
}
```

## Common Bug Patterns

### Null/Undefined

**Problem:**
```typescript
function getName(user: User) {
  return user.profile.name;  // Crash if profile is null
}
```

**Fix:**
```typescript
function getName(user: User): string | null {
  return user.profile?.name ?? null;
}
```

### Off-by-One

**Problem:**
```typescript
for (let i = 0; i <= array.length; i++) {
  console.log(array[i]);  // Undefined on last iteration
}
```

**Fix:**
```typescript
for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
  console.log(array[i]);
}
```

### Type Coercion

**Problem:**
```typescript
if (value == 0) {  // True for '', false, null, 0
  // ...
}
```

**Fix:**
```typescript
if (value === 0) {  // Only true for 0
  // ...
}
```

### Race Conditions

**Problem:**
```typescript
let count = 0;

async function increment() {
  const current = count;
  await delay(10);
  count = current + 1;  // Lost updates!
}
```

**Fix:**
```typescript
let count = 0;
const lock = new Mutex();

async function increment() {
  await lock.acquire();
  try {
    count++;
  } finally {
    lock.release();
  }
}
```

### Missing Await

**Problem:**
```typescript
async function saveUser(user: User) {
  database.save(user);  // Missing await!
  return user;  // Returns before save completes
}
```

**Fix:**
```typescript
async function saveUser(user: User) {
  await database.save(user);
  return user;
}
```

## Documentation

### Bug Fix Commit

```
fix: Handle null profile in getName()

User.profile can be null if user hasn't completed onboarding.
Added null check to prevent crash.

Fixes: #123
Test: Added regression test for null profile case
```

### Session Log

```markdown
# Session: Debug User Profile Crash - 2025-10-01

## Bug Report
- Issue #123: App crashes when viewing incomplete user profiles
- Error: "Cannot read property 'name' of null"

## Investigation
1. Reproduced locally with test user account
2. Traced to `getName()` function in `user-service.ts`
3. Root cause: Assuming profile always exists
4. Profile is null for users who haven't completed onboarding

## Fix
- Added null check using optional chaining
- Return null instead of crashing
- Updated call sites to handle null return

## Testing
- Added regression test for null profile case
- Verified existing tests still pass
- Tested with real incomplete user account

## Prevented
- Added validation in user creation to warn if profile missing
- Updated documentation about profile optionality
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Don't guess and check** - Understand before fixing
❌ **Don't fix symptoms** - Find the root cause
❌ **Don't skip regression tests** - Bug will come back
❌ **Don't refactor while debugging** - Fix first, refactor later
❌ **Don't make large changes** - Minimal fix is best
❌ **Don't assume** - Verify your assumptions
❌ **Don't commit debug code** - Remove console.logs and debuggers

---

## Key Principles

1. **Reproduce first** - Can't fix what you can't see
2. **Find root cause** - Don't just treat symptoms
3. **Minimal fix** - Change as little as possible
4. **Add regression test** - Prevent it from returning
5. **Verify thoroughly** - Ensure it's actually fixed
6. **Document the bug** - Help others learn
7. **Stay focused** - Fix the bug, don't refactor

---

**Remember:** Debugging is detective work. Gather evidence, form hypotheses, test them, find the culprit. Fix it once, test it thoroughly, and make sure it never comes back.
