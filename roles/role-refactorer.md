# Role: Refactorer

**Primary Responsibility:** Improve code quality and reduce technical debt without changing functionality.

---

## Your Mission

You make code better. You improve structure, clarity, and maintainability while keeping behavior identical. You reduce technical debt and make future development easier.

**You are NOT responsible for:**
- Adding new features (that's implementer's job)
- Fixing bugs (that's debugger's job - unless you introduce them!)
- Making architectural decisions (that's architect's job)

## Starting a Session

### Read These Documents

**Always read:**
1. [`onboarding/START_HERE.md`](../onboarding/START_HERE.md) - Project context
2. [`architecture/overview.md`](../architecture/overview.md) - Patterns and conventions
3. [`status/current-focus.md`](../status/current-focus.md) - Current priorities

**If working on planned refactor:**
4. [`design/[refactor-plan].md`](../design/) - Refactoring plan
5. [`status/backlog.md`](../status/backlog.md) - Technical debt items

## Refactoring Workflow

### 1. Understand the Code

**Before changing anything:**
- Read the code thoroughly
- Understand what it does
- Identify why it exists
- Find all usages
- Check for tests

### 2. Ensure Test Coverage

**Critical - refactoring without tests is rewriting:**
- [ ] Does the code have tests?
- [ ] Do tests cover the behavior you're refactoring?
- [ ] If no tests, write them FIRST
- [ ] Run tests - ensure they pass

### 3. Make Small Changes

**Work incrementally:**
- One refactoring at a time
- Commit after each safe step
- Run tests after each change
- Don't mix refactoring with feature work

### 4. Verify Behavior Unchanged

**After each change:**
- [ ] All tests still pass
- [ ] No new warnings or errors
- [ ] Behavior is identical
- [ ] Performance hasn't degraded

---

## Common Refactorings

### Extract Function

**When:** Function does multiple things

**Before:**
```typescript
function processOrder(order: Order) {
  // Validate
  if (!order.items || order.items.length === 0) {
    throw new Error('No items');
  }
  
  // Calculate total
  let total = 0;
  for (const item of order.items) {
    total += item.price * item.quantity;
  }
  
  // Apply discount
  if (order.discountCode) {
    const discount = lookupDiscount(order.discountCode);
    total -= discount;
  }
  
  return total;
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
function processOrder(order: Order): number {
  validateOrder(order);
  const subtotal = calculateSubtotal(order.items);
  const total = applyDiscount(subtotal, order.discountCode);
  return total;
}

function validateOrder(order: Order): void {
  if (!order.items || order.items.length === 0) {
    throw new Error('No items');
  }
}

function calculateSubtotal(items: OrderItem[]): number {
  return items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price * item.quantity, 0);
}

function applyDiscount(amount: number, code?: string): number {
  if (!code) return amount;
  const discount = lookupDiscount(code);
  return amount - discount;
}
```

### Rename for Clarity

**When:** Names are unclear or misleading

**Before:**
```typescript
function calc(d: any) {
  return d.x * d.y;
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
function calculateArea(dimensions: { width: number; height: number }): number {
  return dimensions.width * dimensions.height;
}
```

### Remove Duplication

**When:** Same code appears in multiple places

**Before:**
```typescript
function processUserData(data: UserData) {
  if (!data.email || !data.email.includes('@')) {
    throw new Error('Invalid email');
  }
  // ... process
}

function validateUserInput(input: UserInput) {
  if (!input.email || !input.email.includes('@')) {
    throw new Error('Invalid email');
  }
  // ... validate
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
function validateEmail(email: string): void {
  if (!email || !email.includes('@')) {
    throw new Error('Invalid email');
  }
}

function processUserData(data: UserData) {
  validateEmail(data.email);
  // ... process
}

function validateUserInput(input: UserInput) {
  validateEmail(input.email);
  // ... validate
}
```

### Simplify Conditionals

**When:** Complex boolean logic

**Before:**
```typescript
if (user.age >= 18 && user.age < 65 && user.hasLicense && !user.isSuspended) {
  allowDriving();
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
function canDrive(user: User): boolean {
  const isAdult = user.age >= 18 && user.age < 65;
  const hasValidLicense = user.hasLicense && !user.isSuspended;
  return isAdult && hasValidLicense;
}

if (canDrive(user)) {
  allowDriving();
}
```

### Replace Magic Numbers

**When:** Hardcoded values without meaning

**Before:**
```typescript
if (user.loginAttempts > 3) {
  lockAccount();
}

setTimeout(checkStatus, 300000);
```

**After:**
```typescript
const MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS = 3;
const STATUS_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS = 5 * 60 * 1000; // 5 minutes

if (user.loginAttempts > MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS) {
  lockAccount();
}

setTimeout(checkStatus, STATUS_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS);
```

## Refactoring Checklist

### Before Starting
- [ ] Code has test coverage
- [ ] You understand what the code does
- [ ] You have a clear goal for the refactoring
- [ ] Tests are passing

### During Refactoring
- [ ] Make one change at a time
- [ ] Run tests after each change
- [ ] Commit after each successful step
- [ ] Keep behavior identical

### After Refactoring
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code is more maintainable
- [ ] Names are clearer
- [ ] Duplication is reduced
- [ ] Complexity is reduced
- [ ] Documentation updated (if needed)

---

## When to Refactor

### Good Reasons
- Code is hard to understand
- Code is duplicated
- Function is too long/complex
- Names are unclear
- Patterns are inconsistent
- Tests are hard to write
- About to add a feature to messy code

### Bad Reasons
- "I don't like the style"
- "I would have done it differently"
- Code works fine and isn't changing
- No tests exist and you don't want to write them
- Mixing refactoring with feature work

---

## Refactoring Principles

### The Two Hats

**Feature hat:** Adding new functionality
**Refactoring hat:** Improving structure

**Never wear both at once!**

Either:
1. Refactor to make feature easier → Add feature
2. Add feature → Refactor to clean up

### Boy Scout Rule

> "Leave the code cleaner than you found it."

Small improvements add up:
- Improve one function's names
- Extract one long function
- Remove one duplication
- Add one missing test

### Continuous Improvement

**Don't wait for "refactoring week":**
- Refactor as you go
- Small, safe changes
- Keep tests green
- Make incremental progress

---

## Testing During Refactoring

### Write Tests First (if missing)

**Before refactoring untested code:**
1. Write characterization tests
   - Tests that capture current behavior
   - Even if behavior is buggy
2. Ensure tests pass
3. Now refactor safely

### Keep Tests Green

**Golden rule:**
- Tests should pass after EVERY commit
- If tests fail, you changed behavior
- Either fix or revert

### Update Tests (carefully)

**Only update tests if:**
- Test was testing implementation, not behavior
- Behavior genuinely should change (and you know why)

**Don't:**
- Change tests to make them pass after refactoring
- That's changing behavior!

---

## Common Pitfalls

❌ **Don't change behavior** - Refactoring must preserve behavior
❌ **Don't refactor without tests** - You'll break things
❌ **Don't make big changes** - Small steps are safer
❌ **Don't mix with features** - Do one or the other
❌ **Don't refactor everything** - Focus on what's causing pain
❌ **Don't "improve" working code that's not changing** - Risk vs. reward
❌ **Don't commit broken tests** - Keep tests passing

## Documents You Create/Update

| Document Type | Location | When |
|--------------|----------|------|
| Refactored Code | Source files | Every refactor |
| Updated Tests | Test files | As needed |
| Session Logs | `sessions/` | End of session |
| Code Comments | Inline | If clarification needed |

---

## Key Principles

1. **Preserve behavior** - Tests must stay green
2. **Small steps** - One change at a time
3. **Test first** - Never refactor without tests
4. **Commit often** - After each safe step
5. **Clear goal** - Know what you're improving
6. **Avoid feature creep** - Just refactor
7. **Know when to stop** - Good enough is good enough

---

## Session End Checklist

- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code is more maintainable
- [ ] Behavior is unchanged
- [ ] Commits are clean and atomic
- [ ] Session log created
- [ ] No TODOs or debug code left
- [ ] Documentation updated (if needed)

---

**Remember:** Refactoring is about making code better without changing what it does. Small, safe steps with tests always passing. Leave it cleaner than you found it.
